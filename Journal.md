I had a problem with the floor and drag detection, sometimes the player would have no drag when stopping and would slide after force had stopped being applied.

Couldnt figure out the root of the bug how ever changing the floor to a cube instead if a plane seemed to fix the issue in addition to increasing the project gravity to -30.
